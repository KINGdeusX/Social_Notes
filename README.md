<p>
  You're like a star, one out of reach, <br>
  I gaze at you, but can't draw near. <br>
  I speak your name, yet dare not breach, <br>
  The distant space I hold in fear. <br>
</p>
<p>
  I always knew, deep down inside, <br>
  That closeness was beyond my grasp. <br>
  Your light so bright, I'd be denied, <br>
  Each time I tried, I'd fade, collapse. <br>
</p>
<p>
  Apart by space, I've fought the gap, <br>
  In every way, I sought your light. <br>
  But reaching out, I'd feel the trap, <br>
  Of burning haze that stops my might. <br>
</p>
