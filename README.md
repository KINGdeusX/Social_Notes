You're like a star, one out of reach,
I gaze at you, but can't draw near.
I speak your name, yet dare not breach,
The distant space I hold in fear.
---
I always knew, deep down inside,
That closeness was beyond my grasp.
Your light so bright, I'd be denied,
Each time I tried, I'd fade, collapse.
---
Apart by space, I've fought the gap,
In every way, I sought your light.
But reaching out, I'd feel the trap,
Of burning haze that stops my flight.
